# Merge Sort
Merge sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.
It take a problem into multiple sub-problems.
Each sub-problem is solved individully, 
then sub-problems are combined to form the final problem.

## Process
* Divide the array to a base array of 1 element, recursively.
* Merge each sub-problem.

## Hint
* Pay attention to set boundaries of sub-array in "merge". (Line 60)
